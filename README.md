# yahoo-finance

`yahoo-finance` is [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/) historical quotes and snapshot data downloader written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

The library handles fetching, parsing, and cleaning of CSV data and returns JSON result that is convenient and easy to work with. Both callback (last parameter) and promises (using [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)) styles are supported.

## Important: New Yahoo API

This project is compatible with Yahoo's "new" (and internal) API from
2017-05-16.  Please be aware that Yahoo stopped supporting their API for
developers many years ago, so in theory this could stop working at any time
and without prior notice.  In practice, however, the magic of open-source has
kept this project working reliably and continuously for years and years.

Regarding the package API:

* `historical()` - should work as expected - please check the output and report any inconsistencies.

* `snapshot()` - deprecated - returns the original format for SOME old options via a mapping layer.  Since Yahoo's new API does not contain all the same data as the old version, 100% compatibility is impossible - but for the most common options, this should ease upgrade pains.  When you can, transition to the new `quote()` API instead.

* `quote()` - NEW API more faithful to Yahoo's new API.  See below.  This replaces `snapshot()` and we suggest you use it instead.

* Note: your very first request will take a bit longer to return, as we need to
first send an additional request to Yahoo to get a "crumb" that is used for
all future quests.

## Installation

    $ npm install --save yahoo-finance


## Usage

```js
var yahooFinance = require('yahoo-finance');

yahooFinance.historical({
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  from: '2012-01-01',
  to: '2012-12-31',
  // period: 'd'  // 'd' (daily), 'w' (weekly), 'm' (monthly), 'v' (dividends only)
}, function (err, quotes) {
  //...
});

// This replaces the deprecated snapshot() API
yahooFinance.quote({
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  modules: [ 'price', 'summaryDetail' ] // see the docs for the full list
}, function (err, quotes) {
  // ...
});

```

* [See more comprehensive examples here.](https://github.com/pilwon/node-yahoo-finance/tree/master/examples)

* See the [full quote() docs](docs/quote.md) for the list of all possible
modules and the data they return.

* See also the [deprecated snapshot() API](docs/snapshot.md) docs, for
reference.

        adjClose: 1.38,
        symbol: 'YHOO'
      },
      ...
      {
        date: Thu Nov 14 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
        open: 35.07,

        adjClose: 35.69,
        symbol: 'YHOO'
      }
    ],
    GOOGL: [
      {
        date: Thu Aug 19 2004 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT),
        open: 100,
        high: 104.06,
        low: 95.96,
        close: 100.34,
        volume: 22351900,
        adjClose: 100.34,
        symbol: 'GOOGL'
      },
      ...
      {
        date: Thu Nov 14 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
        open: 1033.92,
        high: 1039.75,
        low: 1030.35,
        close: 1035.23,
        volume: 1166700,
        adjClose: 1035.23,
        symbol: 'GOOGL'
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
  */
});
```

### Specifying request options

Optionally request options (such as a proxy) can be specified by inserting an
extra parameter just before the callback:


```js
var httpRequestOptions = {
  proxy: 'http://localproxy.com'
};


yahooFinance.historical({
  symbol: SYMBOL,
  from: START_DATE,
  to: END_DATE
}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, quotes) {
  // Result
});


yahooFinance.quote({
  symbol: SYMBOL,
  modules: MODULES  // ex: ['price', 'summaryDetail']
}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, snapshot) {
  // Result
});
```
